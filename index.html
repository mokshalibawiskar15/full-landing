        <p>Sindhudurg island-fort was built by Shivaji, the 17th-century ruler of Maratha Empire.[3] Its main objective was to counter the rising influence of foreign (English, Dutch, French and Portuguese) merchants and to curb the rise of Siddis of Janjira.Construction was supervised by Hiroji Indulkar in 1664. The fort was built on a small island known as the Khurte island. </p>

    <div class="section3">
        <p>After selecting the island for building a fort, the auspicious day for building the foundation was chosen as 25th November 1664. There is a sacred rock near Malvan called “Moryacha Dhonda”, which represents has carvings of Lord Ganesh, the Sun and the Moon and Shiv Linga. This sacred rock was worshipped before starting construction of Sindhudurg fort. There are detailed letters which describe many aspects about the vision of building forts of Shivaji Maharaj and the details associated with it. One such letter details out the resources required for Sindhudurg. There were about 500 masons, 200 blacksmiths, 100 Portuguese and 3000 workers who worked for 3 years continuous to complete the fort. The characteristic of Sindhudurg is that the foundation stones are laid down in slots and molten lead was poured to fix them strongly.</p>

        <p>The lime stone was ordered from central part of the Deccan plateau. Shivaji Maharaj had written specific details on resource management in his letters, and was personally present on 29thMarch 1667 when the fort was completed.
            After the death of Rajaram Maharaj in 1700, Tarabai ruled the Maratha Empire from Satara. As per the treaty of Warna between Shahu and Tarabai, Malvan came under her control. By that time piracy had increased near Malvan coast. Major Gordon and Captain Watson captured the fort on 28 January 1765 and renamed it as Fort Augustus. In an Anglo-Maratha truce the fort was returned to Marathas on 2nd January 1766. In 1792 the British again regained the fort by helping Karveerkars against Desai of Nipani.</p>

        <div class="para2">
        <p>Shivaji brought 200 Vaddera people for building this fort. Over 4,000 pounds of lead were used in the casting and foundation stones were firmly laid down. Construction started on 25 November 1664. Built over a period of three years (1664-1667), the sea fort is spread over 48 acres, with a two-mile (3 km) long rampart, and walls that are 30 feet (9.1 m) high and 12 feet (3.7 m) thick. The massive walls were designed to serve as a deterrent to approaching enemies and to the waves and tides of the Arabian Sea. The main entrance is concealed in such a way that no one can pinpoint it from outside</p>

        <div class="para3">
        <p>At a time when traveling by sea was banned by scriptures, this construction on an island represents the revolutionary mindset of its engineer. A remain of an iron mould can be seen.

            The number of permanent residents living in the fort has been in decline since its abandonment. Most residents have moved out due to inadequate employment opportunities but some families remain. The fort is closed for tourists during rainy season due to high tides. </p>
